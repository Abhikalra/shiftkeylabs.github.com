### What I learned from Intro to User Experience

What I found Interesting

There were many parts of the presentation that put user experience into a different perspective for me. The first is that user experience is not just the deliverables. When UX or  UI was mentioned I used to automatically assume that this meant coding and creating websites, apps, and technology based interfaces, which isn’t anywhere near what UX and UI covers. UX is the overarching experience of a service or product, which may have nothing to do with coding and websites at all. UX encompasses research, copy writing, presenting, and prototyping.

What Helped Me

The part of the presentation that helped me the most was the User, Problem, Solution Triangle. This is a concept that I will use going forward in order to find the solution that best fits the presented problem. Although this seems very straight foward and obvious, it changed the way we went about tacking our groups OTN problem. After using this method we realized that there wasn’t currently a problem that we were solving. The problem that we presented would fall into the category of being mild and infrequent. After reevaluating our UPS triangle we also ended up changing who the ideal user would be. By using this method our group was able to come up with a better result for what our user, problem, and solution would be.
