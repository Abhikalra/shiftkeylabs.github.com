# Reflective Blog on UX and UI Class [Presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/SebastianToryPratt/intro-to-user-experience-design-pt-1-lecture-dalhousie-university?qid=c5532a37-bf21-4eb4-b9bb-40b2f43d2176&v=&b=&from_search=9 "SlideShare Link To Presentation"):

    Being a novice blogger, I am still looking for a hooking 
    statement for the post. 

##### Introduction To The Class:

Not many classes start with **"UX? WTF?"**. That was the first impression for 
Sebastian Tory-Pratt. The moment he started the presentation everybody paid attention and thatâ€™s quite an achievement in itself. 
The presentation was well planned and the content was informative and self explanatory. The presentation started off with few online definitions to UX and UI. Then UX or User Experience was termed as *"What it should be?"* and UI or User Interface was termed as *"What it should Look Like?"*. Now moving towards the content, the design was divided into three parts (UPS Model):
1. Users 
2. Problem
3. Solution

Executing the above model, UPS model, itteratively answers the questions which were unanswered initially and the feasibility of various design challenges is goverened. 
##### Class Experience:
The class altogether was a really interacive and there was were time-bound exercises. The time-bound exercises not only helped to speed up the think process and was like playing a game, hence was a fun experience. Although at points the class seemed to going too fast.

The individual brainstorming followed by group brain-storming. The ideas *(observatons, behavious, needs etc. of the user)* were jotted down on the sticky notes and segregated based on their relevance to the *"How do we statement.."*. Then these ideas were then used to improve the **UPS**.

##### Parting Words:
Overall experience for the class was awesome. By the end of the class we had a better understanding about the design process. Then Mr. Pratt asked for the feedback, asking what parts of the class was good and where there is a need to make ammends in order to have a improve learning experience for the next class.
