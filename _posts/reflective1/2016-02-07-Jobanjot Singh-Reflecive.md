# Reflective Blog on Special Grad Topics in Computer Science Class :

​

    Day 1: Free Pizza?? Everything seems so interesting suddenly..!

​

##### Introduction To The Class:

​

Sitting at home chilling, on a typical sunday. I got a call from my friend teling me about this new course that came up. A 3 hour class? no thank you. After much convincing I decided to attend the First lecture and what do you know, **Free Pizza..!!** Need to say more? give me free food and i can even stay there for 6 hours. Soon all the introductions started about the course and Such. Got me a little conused at first about the purpose of the course but then again, i had free Pizza. :)
​

The class model presented was quite interesting at the least and all that was left was to know, **Will it work?** that was the one question i had in mind for the first two if not 3 classes. One of the good things about the class is i would say, *Diversity* in every aspect. Met some cool people form NASCAD and other programs. Sitting with people outide of computerscience and listening to their point of view is pretty intriguing.

##### Class Experience:

I have been in many classes that are interactive and this class is one of the more interactive ones. The amount of brainstorming that i have to go through everyday is a Feat in itsself. I have worked with two diefferent groups as of yet and i literally cant put one above the other. In one of the classes we cameup with a whole Game concept and it did not even feel like we were doing any work. The Way the class transitions from a presentation to a full blown brainstorming session is simply amazing to me.
​

If you ask me three things i really like from this class:
1. Class structure, how everyhting is divided up.
2. People, Definitely people.
3. Atmoshpere.

The **Atmosphere** of the class is really fun and it promotes learning + efficiency. From the outside, class is 3 hours long but it definitely doesnt feel as long.
​

##### Parting Words:

This class has a whole lot different feel than many of the courses in computer science, in a good way. Free pizza or not, i feel like i would have enjoyed this class no less than i already do. i'm really looking forward to seeing where this course will end up at and hopefully it will be all the good places.
