## If I had used the agile approach on a previous project
A few years ago, I was part of a Community Outreach team building a website for our clients. As required for the class, we used the waterfall model. Unfortunately, this caused us to run into issues, as our clients' requirements were not concrete.

We had infrequent meetings with our clients and a small number of large iterations. Because of this, we only heard about changing requirements every one to two weeks, and due to our deliverable format, we sometimes had to wait until the next iteration to make changes. While this was not the entire reason that our group had issues developing a working piece of software, it certainly contributed. Our primary issue was the client failing to provide an API to their data, as the website we were building was supposed to pull its data from their API.

Had we used the Agile methodology, we would have been able to adapt to the changing requirements much faster, as we would have been in contact more frequently and made smaller deliverables, allowing our clients (and their stakeholders) to provide feedback more frequently. This would in turn allow us to plan for and implement their changes faster. Additionally, the Agile methodology requires planning for potential risks throughout the project lifetime. We would have identified the client not providing the API as a risk and had a plan to deal with that situation with an agile approach.

Overall, using the agile methodology would given us a better chance at being able to deal with the issues we encountered while working on the project, and would have led to a better final product for our clients.
