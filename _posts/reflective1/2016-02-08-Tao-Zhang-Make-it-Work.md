### First Reflection
`2016-02-08-Tao Zhang-first-post.md`


### Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 11pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`



### What I learned from this course?
- How to solve the problem by utilizing "Design Thinking".
- How to make the team work collaborates with the people from other specialities and different accents.
- Practicing field research skills.
- Developing my abilities and specialities.

### Where does this end up / how is this turning into a blog?
- We are using github (a code repository hosting site)
- We have a public project storing everything: [Github](https://github.com/shiftkeylabs/shiftkeylabs.github.com)
- we are using something called `Jekyll` which "magically" turns that repository into a blog hosted [here](http://shiftkeylabs.github.io/)
