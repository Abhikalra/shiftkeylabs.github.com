# The way we think about UX/UI 
There has been lots of discussion between what UX/UI means to the outside world. The end user always recieves a product that has, somewhere in it, built with UI & UX however UI $ UX are 2 seperate domains that works together so coherently that sometimes, the lines are too blurred to distinguish between them
## What is UX and UI anyways?
UI or User Inteface is the front end of the application that the user recieves and uses. It is interface by which the computer/mobile interacts to give the user a way to request and respond in terms of various mediums. User Interface can be a button over a mobile app or a website which offers users to book ticket.

However UX or User Experience is something different. User Experience broadens its horizon and focuses on ways of easing usability, providing means of interactive interactions and ensuring that the exprience aggregates all the small bits of Human computer interaction in various forms .

## UX or UI ... Not the same, yet the same
User Interface is the small things like radio buttons, wire frames, check boxes that constitutes towards User Interface, however User Experience incorporates all these aspects and focuses on quality interaction betweeen the system and the User. Eventually, various parts of UI can be constituted to become UX and a UX can be defined by the various parts of UI. 

## Some points to note:
- Without UI, UX cqnnot exist, and without UX, UI cannot.
- UI/UX are ususally similar posts in some companies and may be different in others.
- UI is barred by the technology one is working with while user experience is barred by the way UX engineers imagine it.
