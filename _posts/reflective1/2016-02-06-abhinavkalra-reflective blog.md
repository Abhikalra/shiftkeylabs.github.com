## Creating an effective user experience
Understanding the end-user or consumer lies at the core of creating an effective user experience by any company or organization. While definitions may vary, user experience broadly refers to the overall quality of interaction of a person with any service, product or design. Successful companies are able to align their businesses solutions and products with fulfilling the requirements of their customers. Paramount to this is to be aware of who your end-user will be. This formed the gist of the presentation given by Sebastian Tory-Pratt at the Shift Key Labs.

A user experience design is thus concerned not only with the product or interface design, but rather with the overall experience of the user who will be interacting with it. The shape of the pencil- round as opposed to square or, the usage of proper signs to indicate which way a door will open are a few examples of good UX design.

#### Don't make assumptions 
Having a preconceived notion about what our product will be and who will be using it is a major pitfall that needs to be avoided at all cost. Once we go to the customer, see how they are performing a task and ask what drawbacks are present in their experience, we will often end up back at the drawing board refining our proposed solution. 

#### Now, test our assumptions

The process of gathering this information about our intended users can be broken down into a three pronged approach as described below:
- **Test the user** : Understanding the intended audience, their behaviors, requirements and profiles. Creating personas and storyboards is a great way to test our hypothesis regarding who our end-users will be and how they interact with our solution.
- **Test the problem**: What problem our solution is purportedly solving and how the people are currently addressing this problem.
- **Test the solution**: Have we offered a solution that the people actually need? Are they going to use it? Will it make their task easier?

Through a series of interactive exercises within the class, we went through the tasks for creating an initial User-Problem-Solution statement and refining it further after a more thorough research. Oftentimes we may find that this process is iterative until we effectively refine and retest our solution. 

**U**ser e**X**perience **D**esign is thus a set of flexible practices and approaches that can direct an organization towards creating a successful product for their audience and should be an integral part of the design process for any product or website.
