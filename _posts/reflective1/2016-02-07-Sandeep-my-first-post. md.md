## My Review About Course :
One of my friend told me about this course and when i saw the outline of the course, was very excited and happy. I want to be an entrepreneur, start something by my own. This course giving me a view of that and teaching me that how to put an idea into the real world. In each class I learn something new and challenging. Moreover it’s teaching to me that how to work in a team and each thought, idea have their own importance. Single step can change the whole thing. 
	I like the way of teaching with joy and fun. Also they are giving us live example to explain the points and facts behind any approach. 
 
## First Skiing Trip Experience:
5th Feb, Dalhousie Student union organized a skiing trip for student. It was my first time when I was going for the skiing my life. Just because of this I was very excited and ready to try something new. We went to Wentworth by the bus. First I got my skiing kit and after that I took a lesson for skiing it was real fun and I enjoyed a lot. Then I try skiing on the beginner’s track I fall so many time but in excitement I felt no pain. As we know that practice makes a men perfect so in the end of the day I was doing good skiing and I would love go there again.
