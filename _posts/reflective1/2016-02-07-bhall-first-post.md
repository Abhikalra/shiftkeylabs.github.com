Introduction to User Experience Design
Todays lecture defined user experience design. This definition was broken down into 5 key words from different authors: Overarching, Interactions, Product, service and design. There is also a distinct difference between what UX and UI mean and a lot of people automatically assume they are the same thing. UX is defined as what it should be and UI is defined as what it looks like. There are two kinds of innovation, incremental and disruptive. Something that stuck out in this lecture was to “make the right thing”, not “make the thing right”. A graph of user, problem and solution is where we are right now. Testing all these categories is what research needs to be done before starting anything.

Taking these ideas make breaking down each part of this research plan easier. Defining what the behaviours are for our project make the insight of each decision more considerate to a better solution. It is also important to know how to conduct a proper problem or issue by observing or interviewing the user in their natural habitat. For example, making a focus group and asking questions could put the user on the spot, and they may not give you the true insight needed.  After retrieving our research and insight on our ideal user, this is helpful for really being able to help create a solution. Not automatically assuming or jumping to conclusion is very important for a research plan. Being able to imagine and sometimes think far drastically can really create a better solution than automatically thinking of if it legible or not. Imagining an elevator to the moon is better than simply creating a bridge.
