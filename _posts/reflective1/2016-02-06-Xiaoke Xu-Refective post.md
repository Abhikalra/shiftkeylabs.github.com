# Reflection of the class


## Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 12pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`


### Content:
- The slices and the class is fun. It tells how to focus on the important words as well as understand the long sentences at the first time. Sometimes I cannot catch what the teacher say, but I will try to understand the content.
