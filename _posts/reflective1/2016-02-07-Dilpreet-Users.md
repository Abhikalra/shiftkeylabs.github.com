### About this Class
I find this course interesting and innovative. This class creates environment for new innovative thought. Makes you discover things the way I never imagined I could. Eye opener about the things we could do around our society in systematic manner. How to approach a problem, just donâ€™t reach to solution directly. But go through a process of finding the solution in more prospective way. You might end up having a solution which is more easy to implement and solves some other problems too. As a computer science student this builds up the base for our technical skills.  A technical professional with innovative mind could achieve any goal.

### Seminar
On 1st feb 2016, i attended a seminar about the user experience design. this seminar was focused on how to create a persona which would include all of the user's requirements, needs and goals. One statement that could define about the design a team is going to develop from. What i liked about this seminar is that how interactive it was, chance to brainstrom about each individual aspect of design. Persona was developed through an activity which had four major aspects to it: Behaviour, Need/Goals, Demographics, an image of your potential user. After achieving the persona how we can develop a hypothesis which will state user, what is the problem associated and the what solution we can provide to that problem. interviews are important part to get down to the bottom of the problem, then only we can find the solution to it. Another aspect of the research is user testing which gives definite results. It was great seminar which gave us more to think about our design challenge for the development of  `OTN`.
