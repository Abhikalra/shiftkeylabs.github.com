### Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 11pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`


What I learned from this course?
------------
The most important things I've learned are:
Practicing "Design Thinking" a new method for me of solving problems.
Practicing all Design Thinking steps through working in team.
Exercising brainstorming skills
Exercising field research skills, and interviewing users.
Others two important things:
This program opened a big window on "Design Thinking" and "User Experience"
Work as a team cemented in me more "creative confidence" no fear from mistake,
and gave me the confidence to create a great design.
