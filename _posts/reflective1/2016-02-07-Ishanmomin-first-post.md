### Reflective

What:
- Learned how to design our idea from scratch.
- Worked with different people and formed a group
- Brainstorming on that idea
- Storyboarding and much more.

 
So What:
- I used to believe that working in a team would be waste of time, but this class has gradually increased my experience on working with a team and totally changed my idea.
- It has also taught me new ways of creating a specific idea on the basis of different scattered ideas in my mind on the basis of user experience and team input.
- This has also improve my management skills and confidence in myself.

Now What:
- All this learning will help me increase my experience with a team, how to organize a team and how to manage a team to develop a good idea based on hypothesis.
- I am really looking forward to learn more and increase my experience with some professional advice.
- I am also expecting more interactive activities that are more fun and keeping us involved in work.
