## Instructions of your posts:
- We will be using the language markdown [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- Do not be overly concerned with it, I will help you
- Just copy this file each time, use the same header, modify to suit your needs (the stuff between and including `---`)


### Naming of your blog post

First: note, please name your files:
`year-month-day-author-name-of-post.md`

example:

`2016-01-11-plaroche-first-post.md`


### Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 11pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`



### Incase you get lost or confused:
- find me on slack and ask
- check out [The person who invented Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- Send up flairs

### Where does this end up / how is this turning into a blog?
- We are using github (a code repository hosting site)
- We have a public project storing everything: [Github](https://github.com/shiftkeylabs/shiftkeylabs.github.com)
- we are using something called `Jekyll` which "magically" turns that repository into a blog hosted [here](http://shiftkeylabs.github.io/)
