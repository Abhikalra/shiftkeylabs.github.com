### Course Reflections:
- The second course teaches me before typing cods or drawing it is more important to value the ideas as well as what should I prepared before doing the programs. For example, to list the users' needs and the respond actions are two tips. The course also talks about three necessarities for a written document shoud has and how to write a interface to make it more convenience. 
- The course is really useful for me to do the programs. Because I always do not know what should I prepare before I type cods. Besides I always type cods before valueing the idea . This bad behave always makes me wastes a lot of time.
