# Selling the idea

#### Create a compelling value proposition statement
An idea, no matter how brilliantly conceived, analyzed or tested it may be , will eventually fail if an organization is unable to successfully capture it's customer value proposition. At the intrinsic level, a value proposition clearly conveys how a company's product or service will address the needs of the consumer, states its uniqueness and thus creates brand value. However,an important distinction needs to be made between the customer and the end users. Often times these two may be different and the value proposition statement should communicate this clearly. A good value proposition statement will thus identify the target users,the existing alternatives in the market and how the current solution better addresses the customer needs.

#### Business modeling for lean startups

Once a product has been developed and value proposition identified , the next step is to develop an effective business model that will help translate the idea to a dollar value and a profitable commodity. A business model describes how an organization creates and delivers value. The Business Model Canvas is a template that can help organizations to better develop and organize their business models. It identifies and stresses the key areas which must be captured to design an effective business delivery solution. Some of these areas can include:
##### Customer segments and value propositions
Identify the end users or the customers for whom we are creating value. Along with this we also need to create the value proposition for each identified customer segment which our product is targeting.
##### Delivery Channels and Customer Relationships
These identify how we will deliver the value or services to the customers and sustain business collaboration. It is essential that once a company attracts clients to use its product, they are able to sustain and eventually grow the client base. Effective customer relationship management through services such as maintenance contracts,Call Center support plays crucial role in this scenario.

##### Key Resources, Partners and Revenue Streams

Identify what resources are necessary to develop or deploy our solution. This can include human,financial or intellectual resources. Also identify who would the key partners be in this endeavor. The key partners may differ from the client or customers and generally refer to the suppliers or collaborators. Revenue streams help capture ideal sources for revenue generation such as licensing, subscription, pay-per-use models etc.

Thus, we see that whether your product is big or small, caters to large market or a niche base, having an effective value proposition statement that reaches out to the end user is essential. Having a sound Business Model to create and deliver value often is the differentiating factor between a successful and an unsuccessful product.
