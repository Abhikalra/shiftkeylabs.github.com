# 2016-02-28-Dilpreet- Business Model Canvas
## Shift Key Labs
### Seminar 2
On 22nd Feb 2016, during the class we were introduced to the concept by Dr. Mary kilfoil about the business model canvas. Dr. Mary kilfoil is renowned for her work in entrepreneurship, innovation, and economics. She was very successful in introducing lean program in Dalhousie University and has won many awards at national level. It was privilege to be a part of such informative session. This Canvas model was about how one can invision thier prototype to be a successful one. Different aspects to the design, testing and cost of the instance biuld up for a good model. We worked as a team during this learning session. First we started off by just writing two words on different pieces of paper, all the teams were said to do same. Then these papers were distributed randomly among other teams. Now each team had two random words on which they had to come up with a value proposition. After this activity we were introduce to the Business Canvas Model. We were told to implement our original idea into different stages of this model starting with value proposition to the cost structure. I was certainly new to term 'value proposition' but these activities gave me broader view for our prototype and how we can attach 'OTN' as channels to this project. It was great session and i am hoping for new interesting challenges in this course.
