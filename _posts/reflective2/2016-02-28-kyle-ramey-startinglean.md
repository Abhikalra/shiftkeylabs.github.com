### What?:
Dr Mary Kilfoil gave a presentation on the lean approach to starting a business, focusing on the Lean Canvas. She introduced the ideas that lean business focus on, showed a video overview of the canvas, and ran the class through an activity to fill out several parts of the canvas with our groups. The lean approach involves short iterations and heavy customer discovery. Since your first idea is likely very flawed, the lean approach encourages entrepreneurs to get out of the office and speak with real people - finding their pains, getting their opinions on the product and even setting up pre-sales. 
### So What?:
Having taken Dr. Kilfoil's Starting Lean class in the previous semester, this presentation was a review for me. We practiced the lean approach in her class, where we went through each section of the canvas with a business idea. We refined these ideas through customer discovery and project pivots throught the semester.
This approach is a logical approach for a small business, especially one dealing in software. Developing a product is expensive - designers, developers, and testers cost a lot of money, and developing a product that people aren't interested in is usually a fatal mistake. While you don't need to follow the lean canvas directly, or even the canvas shown in class (as there are alternate canvases), the basic idea of always testing your idea is very important.
### Now What?
We have already put these ideas to use in this class, having done research on pains that people feel about our topics. I suspect this will come into play more heavily throughout the remainder of the project, as we work to develop our ideas.
