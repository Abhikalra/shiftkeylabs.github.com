# Focusing on the customer!
##### Roadmap for the course:

As a graduate student from a Computer Science background and with a little exprience with the industry for me, this course has been pretty much different from all other quintessential courses. And it gets interesting everytime with the fun activities. The course statrted with a goal to design for OTN and use their data. It all started with the **How To?**  statement. Then there was introduction to the *UPS model*, the user, problem and solution model. 
This Monday we were guided to the most important aspect for designing, the customers perspective was discussed.

##### The Activity:
In the beginign of the class, we were assigned new groups for the activity, then we (each group) were asked to write down two words on the sticky notes (different colours):
1. A noun, and
2. An adjective
Then the notes were randomnly distributed amongst the groups. The groups were then asked to think of a product using the two words.

Then we formulated a problem, the two words we got were:
1. tasty,
2. wearable

It was as weird as it sounds, so we came up with a wearable tiffin box for kids. This was the end of group activity.
The next was discussion on the customer for the product we have been working on.
##### The Customer!:
The latter part of the class was focussed on how would our product be beneficial to our intended customers, it was important because till now we had focussed on the inteded user and not the intended customer. In the discussion, we got to learn about a various things. We discussed about:
* Who our intended customer is?
* How do we approach our customer?
* How will our product add value to the customers business?

To conclude, the class was very interactive and we learnt a lot about what can and what cannot be beneficial to our inteded customer.
