# React JS
It is a library for creating user interfaces. Originally built by facebook, It focuses on component design rather than template design. It is used usually for Single page design applications
## React JS features
1. Uses virtual Dom instead of an original one. This allows the only the changes that are made to the UI components to be rendered.
2. React uses JSX which improves over the regular java script and allows better optimization along with the object oriented approach.
3. Can be used as a View of the MVC part.
4. The components are immuteable
5. Heavily optimized performance than any other JS frameworks available.

This submission was part of a Seminar attended at ShiftKey labs on 14th Feburary 2016.
