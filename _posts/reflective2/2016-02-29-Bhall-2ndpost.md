##Starting Point Entrepreneurship Conference
I went to the conference with Jocelyn, we had gotten there at 830 am to register, we got breakfast lunch and dinner. We went to the first lecture about social entrepreneurship, “The good the bad and the ugly” out of starting companies. This lecturer had a lot of experience, was very down to earth, and had great insight on how to incorporate helping the community with any idea. We went to 5 lectures total, there was another where we learned about social media and how to incorporate it successfully within a company, I did not like this lecturer, he seemed to bring down the little guy companies and not actually have talent or a good idea, he just knew how to successfully take over google ads and social media followers.
