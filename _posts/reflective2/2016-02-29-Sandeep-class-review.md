## My Review about last class :
I like the way she started the class. Activity was very impressive and interesting also challenging.  In the first step she told us to write two word, one should be noun and other should be adjective so we (my group) wrote iwatch and technology. 

In the second step she gave us random word which were collected from the other group and told us to formulate a solution for a problem which should be related to those two words. It was very challenging for us to think something within five minute. 

After the activity she explained about the importance of the user selection for our project. Anh we focused on few question. 
1.	Who are the users for your project?
2.	Why are they user for your project? 
3.	What are the limitations?  
4.	How are we going to collect fund for project? 
5.	Who will be the investors? 
From these question we found so many thing for our project.
