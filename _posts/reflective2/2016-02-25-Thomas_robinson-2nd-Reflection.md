## Personal Introduction:

### Due time for posts:
- __Sunday at 11pm__ on slack channel `#assignments`


### Reflection On Lean Model Canvas : 

- Crucially important to align value props with the right market segments. Ask Questions, do marketing and assess interest before building.
- Fail fast to save time and money. Failure equates to a learning experience and is something you need to do. Failure (hypothesis testing) simply means altering your business model before significant investments are made. 
- Ask the right questions and build a valuable network.
