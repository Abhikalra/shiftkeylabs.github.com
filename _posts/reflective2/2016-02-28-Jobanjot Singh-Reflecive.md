# Reflective Blog on the Last class :

​

    When the curtain Rises!

​

##### Scene 1: Enter

​
I walked into the class causally after almost 3 weeks (enough time for me to forget everything), and i see another new face. The elegant woman, who was to be the presenter for last class. I went on to go sit in my group which comprises of 7 people, all with different personalities. Normal interactions begin and it was time for the class to start.
​

##### Scene 2: Commencing the Lecture

The class started with a rather slower place than i expected. It seemed like taking the shape of a typical 3 hour lecture that puts everyone to sleep. The pace of the class quickly changed and i felt alive again. We were asked to chose random numbers between 1-5 and before i knew whats happening, we were sitting in entirely different groups. Interactions began, Names were exchanged and before we knew it, we were talking like we knew each other for a long time.


##### Scene 3: The Task

With the new (But Temporary) groups, we were asked to think of 2 words. 1 noun and 1 adjective. seems easy right? but what do you do when you have no idea what is the pupose and you get lost in the vast pool of all the words you can chose. so what happens? we fail to chose anything for the first 3 minutes and then randomly choose 2 words out of no where. The real fun started when all the words written by different teams get shuffled and now everyone has new or same words to work with and comeup with a problem and its solution. WOW. I definitely did not see that one coming. It was fun talking to the team and coming up with interesting little ideas that seemed totally undoable but were fun to think of.

​
Finally, we saw everyones ideas and we were sent back to our original teams. The little exercise was fun and it made everyone pay more attenton to the class. Following the exercise we sat through the presentation, learning interesting stuff.
​

##### THE END

​
The class to say was not one of the best ones we had in this course but it ranks pretty high up in the chart. It is always fun to team up with newer people and seeing their thought process. Looking forward to the next class.
