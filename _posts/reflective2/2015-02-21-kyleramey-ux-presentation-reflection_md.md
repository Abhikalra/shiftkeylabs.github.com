## UX? WTF?
Over the break, I reviewed the *UX? WTF?* presentation by Sebastian Tory-Pratt. The presentation covered working through planning, designing, prototyping, and testing a product.

The presentation was both interesting and informative. As a developer, it provided insight into how designers think and introduced a way to bridge the gap between the two - Object Oriented User Experience. I was familiar with many of the processes described in the presentation regarding user testing and prototyping, but it was helpful to see it explained at length, all at once, as it helped make the big picture clearer. In particular, the description of the Minimum Viable Product and the alternative Minimum Lovable Product was very good to have properly described.

I started applying the lessons learned from this presentation in a project for another class, as, over the past week, I have worked on all of the topics covered save the user testing. Following the steps helped keep me on track and organized. I ended up with a much better prototype, as I had worked through all of the user interactions and stories first. This technique is very useful, and I can easily see myself referring back to these videos for future projects.
